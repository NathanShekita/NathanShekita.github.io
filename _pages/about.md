I'm an MBA & MPH graduate from Yale interested in healthcare, antitrust, and data analytics. I've published research in economics and continue to engage in the field. 

In my spare time, I enjoy coding and documenting the empirical methods I've implemented as a researcher. Some of this work has even been featured on the [front page of the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/upshot/the-company-behind-many-surprise-emergency-room-bills.html).
